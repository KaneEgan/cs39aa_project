The data was taken from book reviews on Amazon. The written review text will be classified as postive or negative. Since Amazon rates from 1 to 5 the scores of 1-2 will be considered negative, 3 will be considered nuetral, and 4 to 5 as positive. After the written review is classified as positive or negative it will be compared to the score given by the reviewer.
