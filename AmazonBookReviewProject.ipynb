    "\n",
    "The purpose of this model is to use three million book reviews with 212,404 unique books from a dataset named Amazon Book Reviews to predict if a book recieved a positive or negative rating based on the written review. The data was taken from book reviews on Amazon. The written review text will be classified as postive or negative. Since Amazon rates from 1 to 5 the scores of 1-2 will be considered negative, 3 will be considered nuetral, and 4 to 5 as positive. After the written review is classified as positive or negative it will be compared to the score given by the reviewer. The link to this dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews?select=Books_rating.csv. "
